## Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Register, login, logout with JWT access tokens (15 min) and refresh tokens (7 days)
- Token family rotation — detects and prevents refresh token reuse attacks
- Email verification with tokenized links (24h expiry)
- Password reset flow (forgot password, reset with token)
- Role-based access control (CUSTOMER, ADMIN) with guards
- `@Public()` decorator to opt routes out of authentication
- Hashed refresh tokens and password reset tokens stored in database

### User Management

- Profile management (view, update name)
- Password change with current password verification
- Address book — CRUD for shipping/billing addresses with default selection
- Admin: list users, view details, update roles, deactivate, hard delete

### Product Catalog

- **Categories** — hierarchical tree structure with parent/child relationships, auto-generated slugs, image uploads, soft delete
- **Products** — full CRUD with filtering (category, price range, featured), case-insensitive search, dynamic sorting, pagination, Cloudinary image uploads with auto-optimization

### Inventory Management

- Real-time stock tracking with reserved stock calculations
- Stock movement audit trail (adjustments, reservations, releases, sales, returns, restocks)
- Low-stock threshold alerts with admin notifications
- Transactional stock operations (atomic read + update)

### Shopping Cart

- Authenticated user carts with lazy creation
- Guest carts (session-based, 30-day expiry) with merge on login
- Add, update quantity, remove items, clear cart
- Product availability and stock validation on every operation
- Coupon application with live discount preview

### Orders & Checkout

- Atomic checkout — creates order, reserves stock, clears cart in a single transaction
- Order number generation (`ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`)
- Product snapshots at order time (name, SKU, price, image preserved)
- Address snapshot on order (survives address edits/deletion)
- Server-side price, tax, and shipping calculation (never trusts client)
- Status workflow: PENDING → CONFIRMED → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED (or CANCELLED)
- Status transition validation via state machine
- Customer order history with filtering by status and date
- Cancel orders (PENDING/CONFIRMED only)
- Refund request flow with admin review

### Payments (Stripe)

- PaymentIntent creation with idempotency keys
- Webhook processing with signature verification and event deduplication
- Full refund lifecycle — REFUND_PENDING → REFUNDED (via webhook confirmation)
- Failed payment/refund tracking with error codes from Stripe
- Abandoned payment cleanup (auto-expires after 24h)
- Currency handling (PLN → groszy conversion for Stripe)

### Reviews & Ratings

- Purchase-verified reviews (only buyers with paid orders can review)
- Moderation workflow — PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED by admin
- Edits reset status to PENDING for re-moderation
- Denormalized average rating and review count on products
- One review per user per product

### Coupons & Discounts

- Percentage and fixed-amount discount types
- Validation rules: minimum order amount, maximum discount cap, usage limits (global + per-user)
- Validity window (start/end dates) with active/inactive toggle
- Usage tracking per user per order
- Integrated into checkout flow with atomic usage recording

### Shipping

- Flat-rate shipping methods with configurable pricing
- Free shipping threshold per method
- Estimated delivery days
- Shipping method name snapshot on orders

### Tax

- Configurable tax rates with percentage-based calculation
- Integrated into checkout total computation

### Notifications

- **Dual-channel delivery** — in-app (database) + email (Resend)
- **15 email templates** — welcome, order lifecycle, payment confirmations, refund updates, low stock alerts
- **Event-driven architecture** — 11 event types with 4 dedicated listeners (auth, orders, payments, inventory)
- Unread count badge, mark as read (single/all), notification preferences (opt-out model)
- Admin broadcast for low stock alerts (sent to all active admins)
- Idempotency check (prevents duplicate notifications within 1 minute)
- Async email delivery via BullMQ with retry and exponential backoff

### Background Jobs

- **Email queue** — async delivery with 3 retries and exponential backoff
- **7 scheduled cleanup jobs:**

| Job                        | Schedule         | Description                          |

| Expired refresh tokens     | Daily 3:00 AM    | Delete expired/revoked tokens        |
| Expired verification tokens| Daily 3:05 AM    | Clear stale email verification       |
| Expired reset tokens       | Daily 3:10 AM    | Clear stale password reset tokens    |
| Expired guest carts        | Daily 3:15 AM    | Delete expired guest carts           |
| Abandoned payments         | Hourly           | Expire 24h+ pending payments         |
| Old webhook events         | Weekly Sun 4:00 AM | Delete 30+ day old events          |
| Old notifications          | Weekly Sun 4:30 AM | Delete 90+ day old read notifications|

### File Storage (Cloudinary)

- Product and category image uploads (multipart form-data)
- Buffer-based uploads (no temp files on disk)
- File validation — MIME type (JPG, PNG, WebP) and size (5 MB max)
- Auto-optimization — `quality: auto`, `format: auto`
- Organized by folder (`products/`, `categories/`)
- Cleanup on image removal and entity hard delete

### Health Checks

- `GET /health` — liveness probe (app is running)
- `GET /health/ready` — readiness probe (database + Redis connectivity)

## Global Request Pipeline

Every request flows through these globally-registered providers in order:

```
Request → Rate Limiter → JWT Auth → Role Guard → Zod Validation → [Handler] → Response Envelope → Error Filter → Response
```

| Stage                    | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ThrottlerGuard**       | 3-tier rate limiting (3/1s, 20/10s, 100/60s)                   |
| **JwtAuthGuard**         | JWT validation on all routes; `@Public()` to opt out            |
| **RolesGuard**           | Role-based access; `@Roles('ADMIN')` to restrict                |
| **ZodValidationPipe**    | Request body/query/param validation via Zod schemas             |
| **TransformInterceptor** | Wraps successful responses in `{ data, meta }` envelope         |
| **GlobalExceptionFilter**| Standardized error responses; maps Prisma errors to HTTP codes  |

## Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all required variables. Key groups:

| Group           | Variables                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **App**         | `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN`     |
| **Database**    | `DATABASE_URL`                                         |
| **JWT**         | `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, expiration configs  |

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pnpm test

# Run a specific test file
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern=auth.service

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:cov
```

- **41 test suites** with **605+ unit tests**
- Services, controllers, guards, filters, interceptors, and event listeners all tested
- Dependencies mocked via custom factories (`createMockPrismaClient`, Stripe, Cloudinary, BullMQ)
- Coverage thresholds enforced: 80% lines/functions, 70% branches

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs **3 parallel jobs** on every PR and push to main:

| Job       | Timeout | Description                          |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Lint**  | 5 min   | ESLint checks                        |
| **Test**  | 10 min  | All 605+ unit tests via Jest         |
| **Build** | 5 min   | TypeScript compilation (type safety) |

- pnpm dependency caching for fast runs
- `--frozen-lockfile` to prevent dependency drift
- Concurrency control (cancels stale PR runs, never cancels main)
- Least-privilege permissions (`contents: read`)

## Security

- JWT authentication with short-lived access tokens and hashed refresh tokens
- Token family rotation to detect reuse attacks
- bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12)
- 3-tier rate limiting (short, medium, long windows)
- Helmet HTTP security headers
- CORS with configurable origins
- Zod validation on all inputs (whitelist + strip unknown fields)
- Prisma parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- No stack traces or internal details leaked in error responses
- Environment validation at startup (fails fast on misconfiguration)
